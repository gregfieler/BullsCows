# Notes about the kinds of things to glean from the data
average number of guesses for each game size

populating stats file

base training set: (run for factor variations) - end goal use ML to determine most effective factors

[ ] 2x7  [ ] 123 [ ] 999 [ ] noseed

[ ] 3x7  [ ] 123 [ ] 999 [ ] noseed

[ ] 4x7  [ ] 123 [ ] 999 [ ] noseed

[ ] 5x7  [ ] 123 [ ] 999 [ ] noseed

[ ] 6x7  [ ] 123 [ ] 999 [ ] noseed

## parameters

to make the stats useful i have been seeding the answer (but not the guesses) to understand how programming changes affect the results

i have just started to modify factors to see how the weights are working out.

## details
most previous tests were at b.5c.3
running a bunch of tests at equal weight - 300@3x7 etc (depends on if I monitor)
when this is done I will kick off b.7c.3 and run big test

look at repeated guesses clue - seems to be higher with b.7c.3 (not sure) but check results.  Does higher repeated guesses yield better results?
